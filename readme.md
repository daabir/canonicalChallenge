## About:  

This repository contains solution for a node assessment that I was asked to complete by  
_insert company name_ for the role of Frontend Developer.  
Although I did clear all the assessments but I couldn't get an interview from them for  
some legitimate reasons(that's what I was told).  
The reason I am putting this up here because it is an interesting problem.
